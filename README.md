# AI-Powered Airline Call Center Optimization

This repository contains solutions for two independent problems:

1. **Problem 1** (`problem1/`) – Multi-agent airline information system using
   structured JSON function calls.
2. **Problem 2** (`problem2/`) – Binary sentiment classification for airline
   customer feedback.

Each folder includes its own README, requirements, and placeholder `api_keys.env`
file as requested.

## Repository Contents

- `problem1/agent_system.py` – Info Agent and QA Agent implementation.
- `problem2/ml_classifier.py` – Sentiment training & prediction functions.
- `2026 dataset.csv` – Provided dataset for Problem 2 (kept at the root so both
  problems can access it).

Follow the instructions inside each problem folder for environment setup and
usage examples.
